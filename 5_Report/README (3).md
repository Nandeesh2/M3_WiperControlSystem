# Wiper Control system
this project is mainly concentrate about the working wiper control system

# Wiper
INTRODUCTION 

Meaning- a long, thin piece of rubber on a metal frame that moves back and forth and pushes water, snow, etc., off the surface of the window at the front of a car, truck, etc.

Why to use wiper???

To clean the cars windsheild from any type of water during the rainy season or while cleaning the car.

A windscreen wiper, windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin—and some aircraft—are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.

A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility, from its surface. On vehicles made after 1969, the speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds, and often one or more intermittent settings. Most personal automobiles use two synchronized radial-type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms.

On some vehicles, a windscreen washer system is also used to improve and expand the function of the wiper(s) to dry or icy conditions. This system sprays water, or an antifreeze window washer fluid, at the windscreen using several well-positioned nozzles. This system helps remove dirt or dust from the windscreen when it is used in concert with the wiper blades. When antifreeze washer fluid is used, it can help the wipers remove snow or ice. For these types of winter conditions, some vehicles have additional heaters aimed at the windows, embedded heating wire(s) in the glass, or embedded heating wire(s) in the wiper blade; these defroster systems can melt ice or help to keep snow and ice from building up on the windscreen. Less frequently, miniature wipers are installed on headlights to ensure that they function optimally.

Wipers may be powered by a variety of means, although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components, typically two 4-bar linkages in series or parallel.

Vehicles with air-operated brakes sometimes use pneumatic wipers, powered by tapping a small amount of pressurized air from the brake system to a small air operated motor mounted on or just above the windscreen. These wipers are activated by opening a valve which allows pressurized air to enter the motor.

Early wipers were often driven by a vacuum motor powered by manifold vacuum. This had the drawback that manifold vacuum varies depending on throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop. That problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum booster pump.

## Advantages

Windshield wipers are a small part of your car, but they have a big impact on your driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly and smoothly at the push of a button!

The windshield wiper motor moves the windshield wiper arms across the windshield. The metal or hard plastic arms drag a thin rubber (or silicone) blade across the windshield to clear away water, giving you a better view of the road.

Over time, windshield wiper blades crack, tear and lose their flexibility and functionality. Everything from road grit to bird droppings to extreme temperatures to ultraviolet rays contributes to wipers’ breakdown.

So even if you hardly use them, wiper blades still need to be replaced at regular intervals.

## Dis Advantages

Squeaking or chattering sounds when in use

Skipping motion in the wiper’s movement

Streaking, smears or gaps of moisture on your windshield

Reduced driving visibility, even with the wipers in motion

Cracks, tear or missing pieces of the blade


## Conclusion

As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system
was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the
design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this field
